            <h1>Our history</h1>
            <br/>
            <p>Again and again we have observed the time-consuming manual cleaning of the dirty cargo holds of livestock transporters in rural areas (Rietberg in North Rhine-Westphalia). Through our jobs in the manufacturing industry and the knowledge we acquired, we both came up with the idea of ​​developing an automated solution for this regular, inefficient, unpleasant, time-consuming work. In the further steps we found that truck trailers and sea containers are cleaned by hand with high-pressure cleaners worldwide. The protocols and guidelines of food logistics also require a certified cleaning of the holds.</p>
